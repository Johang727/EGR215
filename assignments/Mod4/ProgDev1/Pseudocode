Write a program that will create a moving average plot of the NASA global temperature anomaly data for a user specified moving average window. 

The user will specify a window size that should be an odd number of years. 

The program should calculate the required moving average for as many years in the data as possible and then create a plot of the annual data, shown with data symbols, and the moving average, shown as a solid line.

PROGRAM plot_temp_anomaly
    Load Data from TXT

    get minimum and maximum years possible for range

    WHILE not exit DO
        Get start year from user
        Get end year from user

        IF end year - start year % 2 == 0 THEN
            // the input is even, restart
            print "Enter an odd time interval"
            continue
        ENDIF

        IF end year - start year < 0 THEN
            // invalid year range, restart
            print "Enter a valid range"
            continue
        ENDIF

        IF start year < min year OR end year > max year THEN
            // invalid year range, restart
            print "Enter a valid range"
            continue
        exit = true
    ENDWHILE

    FOR range start year to end year
        Plot Value
    ENDFOR

    Plot average line for whole graph

ENDPROGRAM
