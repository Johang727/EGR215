Write a program that will create a moving average plot of the NASA global temperature anomaly data for a user specified moving average window. 

The user will specify a window size that should be an odd number of years. 

The program should calculate the required moving average for as many years in the data as possible and then create a plot of the annual data, shown with data symbols, and the moving average, shown as a solid line.

PROGRAM plot_temp_anomaly
    Load Data from TXT

    get minimum and maximum years possible for range

    WHILE not exit DO
        Get interval to calculate moving average

        Check if integer

        IF interval % 2 == 0 THEN
            // the input is even, restart
            print "Enter an odd year interval."
            continue
        ENDIF

        IF interval is negative THEN
            print "Enter a positive number."
            continue
        
        IF interval > max year - min year THEN
            print "Time interval too big, please enter a smaller one."
            continue

        exit = true
    ENDWHILE

    FOR range start year to end year, increase by interval
        log values
    ENDFOR

    FOR 

    Plot average line for whole graph

ENDPROGRAM
